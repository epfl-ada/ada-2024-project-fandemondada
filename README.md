# Beer and politics: a study on American beer consumption
## Abstract: 
In this period of deep political turmoil in the USA making the country more divided than ever, we want to find out if this Democrat - Republican division can also be found in the beers drunk. In this project, we will investigate the links between the political orientation of the American states and beer consumption and production in them.
Specifically, we will begin by deep diving into each State’s favourite beers based on RateBeer and BeerAdvocate reviews and find out which beers represents the state the best. In parallel, we will look into what beers are being produced in each State to discover the one most representative of it.
Finally, we will try to find some correlations between the beers we just found and the political orientation of each state during the American 2016 presidential elections.
## Research questions:
-	Based on the reviews from American users, what is the beer most liked in a state? More specifically, we will find out the characteristics of a beer and propose a candidate most representative of it.
-	Based on the origin of the beers reviewed, what is the beer most produced in a state? Is it also the most liked? We will use the absolute number of beers coming from the state and not the volume produced.
-	Can we find a correlation between the beers we just found and the political orientation of the states? Is it possible to find out the “standard” democrat beer and the “standard” republican one?
